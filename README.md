### Project Introduction
The Titanic disaster is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, resulting in the deaths of more than 1,500 passengers and crew. This project aims to analyze the passenger data from the Titanic to uncover insights into the factors that influenced survival rates. By performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), we will explore relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

### Project Summary
This project involves the following steps:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data to uncover relationships between different variables and identify significant patterns.
3. **Insights and Trends**: Analyzing the cleaned data to draw meaningful conclusions about the factors affecting passenger survival rates on the Titanic.

### Business Objective
The primary objective of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of the factors that influenced the survival rates of passengers on the Titanic. By analyzing the dataset, we aim to:
- Identify key variables that had a significant impact on survival rates, such as passenger class, age, gender, fare, and embarked port.
- Provide visualizations that clearly depict these relationships and trends.
- Offer insights that can inform future safety measures and decision-making processes in maritime travel and disaster management.
